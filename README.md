# Lab 36 - Coding Interview Techniques

## Overview

Coding interviews are coming your way. Time to memorize 15,000 interview questions?

No! It's time to focus on the core problem solving techniques that can solve any interview question.

## Feature Tasks & Requirements

Watch these videos and start practicing:

* [Top 10 Algorithm Techniques for Coding Interview part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1MXwyiGi_U)
* [Top 10 Algorithm Techniques for Coding Interview part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHczhZn-z30)
* [5 Things to avoid in Coding Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FowJZqVggCU)

List from video:

1. Depth-First Search
2. Breadth-First Search
3. Matching parenthesis/brackets
4. Using hashtables
5. How to manipulate multiple variable pointers at once
6. Reversing a Linked List
7. Sorting Fundamentals
8. Recursion
9. Knowing how to construct custom data-structures
10. Binary Search

## Implementation Notes

* Submission is text version of whiteboard for 3 - or more - code challenges of your choosing.
  * The challenges should relate to the Top 10 list in the videos
  * Select challenges that best align with your Coding Interview needs
  * Choose from LeetCode, Exercism, HackerRank, etc - or even previous code challenges
* No python files accepted. All work should be done in a simple text file.
  * Google Doc or Firepad links also acceptable

## My Submission

[My 1st code challenge](challenge_1.txt) - Traverse a linked list recursively and return the largest value

[My 2nd code challenge](challenge_2.txt) - Given a Binary Tree, Find the maximum value RECURSIVELY

[My 3rd code challenge](challenge_3.txt) - Given a Queue, determine if a specific value is present RECURSIVELY
